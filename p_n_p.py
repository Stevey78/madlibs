# Pride & Prejudice (Jane Austen)


# It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
# of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feeling
# or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this
# truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
# considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
